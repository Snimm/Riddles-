I pop like a balloon near fire, stars burn me to produce their godly wildfire/ire .

I am the only book you take a oath to say no lie because if found guilty you will definitely cry.

I connect two points in space , the reason I'm born is a single case , sometimes I'm made of metal , if gone , consequences can be detrimental

Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces.

Crimson red is my body color , transparent in color is what I throw , I can save you or harm you with my force of flow.

I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer.

I am a basket that cannot contain anything for I have a hole , when something gets through me ,it's called a goal and that is my only role.
