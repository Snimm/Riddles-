1    
The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white 


2    
I am a screen you cannot touch but only control. 


3    
Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode 


4    
You can prove your innocence here with the help of a man clad in black. 


5    
I can write sentences but I don't know what they mean , without the power light in a black armor, I'm a dead machine  


6    
Find the meaning of life. 


7    
I am the only book you take a oath to say no lie because if found guilty you will definitely cry. 


8    
I am a basket that cannot contain anything for I have a hole , when something gets through me ,it's called a goal and that is my only role. 


9    
I can watch but can't act , people use me to check the matter of facts. 


10    
Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces.
