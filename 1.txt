I am a screen you cannot touch but only control. 


2    
I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics. 


3    
Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode 


4    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


5    
With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me. 


6    ï»¿I have a part of you but not the rest neither in flesh nor in blood 


7    
I can write sentences but I don't know what they mean , without the power light in a black armor, I'm a dead machine  


8    
I am the only book you take a oath to say no lie because if found guilty you will definitely cry. 


9    
Find the meaning of life. 


10    
I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me
