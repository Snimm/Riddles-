Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces. 


2    
I have an upbeat nature but i can't smile , to use me you need an Mp3 file 


3    
Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode 


4    
Direction of flow can be deduced so is the end matters status , follow the footsteps to pin fin apparatus 


5    
The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white 


6    
I can watch but can't act , people use me to check the matter of facts. 


7    
I connect two points in space , the reason I'm born is a single case , sometimes I'm made of metal , if gone , consequences can be detrimental 


8    
I am the only book you take a oath to say no lie because if found guilty you will definitely cry. 


9    
I am a screen you cannot touch but only control. 


10    
With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me.
