With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me.

Crimson red is my body color , transparent in color is what I throw , I can save you or harm you with my force of flow.

I have the base structure of the one reading this ,but without the details 


4    
I am the only book you take a oath to say no lie because if found guilty you will definitely cry. 


5    
I only go up and down but I control if something in a room can be found

I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics.

Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode 


8    
I am a basket that cannot contain anything for I have a hole , when something gets through me ,it's called a goal and that is my only role.
