1    
I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me 


2    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


3    
I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics. 


4    
Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode 


5    
Crimson red is my body color , transparent in color is what I throw , I can save you or harm you with my force of flow. 


6    
With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me. 


7    
I am the only book you take a oath to say no lie because if found guilty you will definitely cry. 


8    
Direction of flow can be deduced so is the end matters status , follow the footsteps to pin fin apparatus 


9    
I can watch but can't act , people use me to check the matter of facts. 


10    
The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white
