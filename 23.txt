1    
I am a screen you cannot touch but only control. 


2    
I pop like a balloon near fire, stars burn me to produce their godly wildfire/ire . 


3    ï»¿I have a part of you but not the rest neither in flesh nor in blood 


4    
Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode 


5    
I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me 


6    
My blade is used in medical surgeries, I am created in volcanic forgeries , I can make the sharpest blade that there is, I can found in civil laboratories laboratories. 


7    
I am a basket that cannot contain anything for I have a hole , when something gets through me ,it's called a goal and that is my only role. 


8    
I only go up and down but I control if something in a room can be found 


9    
I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics. 


10    
I connect two points in space , the reason I'm born is a single case , sometimes I'm made of metal , if gone , consequences can be detrimental
