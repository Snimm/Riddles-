The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white 


2    
I am a place where you can find artificially created colors contained in heated glass. 


3    
I am a screen you cannot touch but only control. 


4    
Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode 


5    
Find the meaning of life. 


6    
Crimson red is my body color , transparent in color is what I throw , I can save you or harm you with my force of flow. 


7    ï»¿I have a part of you but not the rest neither in flesh nor in blood 


8    
You can prove your innocence here with the help of a man clad in black. 


9    
I have the base structure of the one reading this ,but without the details 


10    
I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics.
