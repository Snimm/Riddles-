I pop like a balloon near fire, stars burn me to produce their godly wildfire/ire . 


2    
Crimson red is my body color , transparent in color is what I throw , I can save you or harm you with my force of flow. 


3    
Direction of flow can be deduced so is the end matters status , follow the footsteps to pin fin apparatus 


4    
I have an upbeat nature but i can't smile , to use me you need an Mp3 file 


5    
Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces. 


6    
The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white 


7    
Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode 


8    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


9    
I am a screen you cannot touch but only control. 


10    
You can prove your innocence here with the help of a man clad in black.
