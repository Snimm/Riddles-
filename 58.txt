I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me

My blade is used in medical surgeries, I am created in volcanic forgeries , I can make the sharpest blade that there is, I can found in civil laboratories laboratories.

I am the only book you take a oath to say no lie because if found guilty you will definitely cry.

I only go up and down but I control if something in a room can be found

I have an upbeat nature but i can't smile , to use me you need an Mp3 file

I am a place where you can find artificially created colors contained in heated glass.

The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white

I am a screen you cannot touch but only control.

I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics.
