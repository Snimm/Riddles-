1    ï»¿I have a part of you but not the rest neither in flesh nor in blood 


2    
I pop like a balloon near fire, stars burn me to produce their godly wildfire/ire . 


3    
Crimson red is my body color , transparent in color is what I throw , I can save you or harm you with my force of flow. 


4    
Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces. 


5    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


6    
I can watch but can't act , people use me to check the matter of facts. 


7    
With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me. 


8    
I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics. 


9    
Find the meaning of life. 


10    
The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white
