I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


2    
I am a screen you cannot touch but only control. 


3    
I am a place where you can find artificially created colors contained in heated glass. 


4    
I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me 


5    
Find the meaning of life. 


6    
I have the base structure of the one reading this ,but without the details 


7    
Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces. 


8    
Direction of flow can be deduced so is the end matters status , follow the footsteps to pin fin apparatus 


9    
Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode 


10    
With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me.
