I have an upbeat nature but i can't smile , to use me you need an Mp3 file

I am the only book you take a oath to say no lie because if found guilty you will definitely cry.

I am a screen you cannot touch but only control.

With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me.

I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics.

Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces.

Find the meaning of life.

I only go up and down but I control if something in a room can be found
