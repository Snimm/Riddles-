1    
I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me 


2    
The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white 


3    
I have an upbeat nature but i can't smile , to use me you need an Mp3 file 


4    
I only go up and down but I control if something in a room can be found 


5    
With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me. 


6    
Find the meaning of life. 


7    
I am a basket that cannot contain anything for I have a hole , when something gets through me ,it's called a goal and that is my only role. 


8    
I am the only book you take a oath to say no lie because if found guilty you will definitely cry. 


9    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


10    
I am a place where you can find artificially created colors contained in heated glass.
