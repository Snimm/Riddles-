1    
You can prove your innocence here with the help of a man clad in black. 


2    
With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me. 


3    
I have the base structure of the one reading this ,but without the details 


4    
Crimson red is my body color , transparent in color is what I throw , I can save you or harm you with my force of flow. 


5    
I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me 


6    
I connect two points in space , the reason I'm born is a single case , sometimes I'm made of metal , if gone , consequences can be detrimental 


7    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


8    
I pop like a balloon near fire, stars burn me to produce their godly wildfire/ire . 


9    
I can write sentences but I don't know what they mean , without the power light in a black armor, I'm a dead machine  


10    
My blade is used in medical surgeries, I am created in volcanic forgeries , I can make the sharpest blade that there is, I can found in civil laboratories laboratories.
