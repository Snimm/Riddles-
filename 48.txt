1    
I am a place where you can find artificially created colors contained in heated glass. 


2    
You can prove your innocence here with the help of a man clad in black. 


3    
The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white 


4    ï»¿I have a part of you but not the rest neither in flesh nor in blood 


5    
I can watch but can't act , people use me to check the matter of facts. 


6    
I pop like a balloon near fire, stars burn me to produce their godly wildfire/ire . 


7    
With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me. 


8    
My blade is used in medical surgeries, I am created in volcanic forgeries , I can make the sharpest blade that there is, I can found in civil laboratories laboratories. 


9    
I am a basket that cannot contain anything for I have a hole , when something gets through me ,it's called a goal and that is my only role. 


10    
Crimson red is my body color , transparent in color is what I throw , I can save you or harm you with my force of flow.
