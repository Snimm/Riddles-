Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces. 


2    
I have the base structure of the one reading this ,but without the details 


3    
I can write sentences but I don't know what they mean , without the power light in a black armor, I'm a dead machine  


4    
I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me 


5    
Direction of flow can be deduced so is the end matters status , follow the footsteps to pin fin apparatus 


6    
Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode 


7    
With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me. 


8    
I pop like a balloon near fire, stars burn me to produce their godly wildfire/ire . 


9    
My blade is used in medical surgeries, I am created in volcanic forgeries , I can make the sharpest blade that there is, I can found in civil laboratories laboratories. 


10    
I am a screen you cannot touch but only control.
