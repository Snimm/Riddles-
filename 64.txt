I have an upbeat nature but i can't smile , to use me you need an Mp3 file

With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me. 


3    
I only go up and down but I control if something in a room can be found 


4    
I am a screen you cannot touch but only control. 


5    
I can watch but can't act , people use me to check the matter of facts. 


6    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


7    
I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me 


8    
Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode 


9    
The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white

You can prove your innocence here with the help of a man clad in black.
