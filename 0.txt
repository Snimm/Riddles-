I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics.

I only go up and down but I control if something in a room can be found 


3    
Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode 


4    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


5    
Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces. 


6    
You can prove your innocence here with the help of a man clad in black.

I connect two points in space , the reason I'm born is a single case , sometimes I'm made of metal , if gone , consequences can be detrimental 


8    
With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me.

The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white

I am a screen you cannot touch but only control.
