I connect two points in space , the reason I'm born is a single case , sometimes I'm made of metal , if gone , consequences can be detrimental

I am a place where you can find artificially created colors contained in heated glass. 


3    
I can watch but can't act , people use me to check the matter of facts. 


4    
I have an upbeat nature but i can't smile , to use me you need an Mp3 file 


5    
Find the meaning of life. 


6    
I only go up and down but I control if something in a room can be found

With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me. 


8    ï»¿I have a part of you but not the rest neither in flesh nor in blood

Crimson red is my body color , transparent in color is what I throw , I can save you or harm you with my force of flow.

The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white
