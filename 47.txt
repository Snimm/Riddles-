1    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


2    
I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me 


3    
I can write sentences but I don't know what they mean , without the power light in a black armor, I'm a dead machine  


4    
Direction of flow can be deduced so is the end matters status , follow the footsteps to pin fin apparatus 


5    
I pop like a balloon near fire, stars burn me to produce their godly wildfire/ire . 


6    
I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics. 


7    
I can watch but can't act , people use me to check the matter of facts. 


8    
I am a place where you can find artificially created colors contained in heated glass. 


9    
Crimson red is my body color , transparent in color is what I throw , I can save you or harm you with my force of flow. 


10    
I am the only book you take a oath to say no lie because if found guilty you will definitely cry.
