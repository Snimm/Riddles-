1    
The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white 


2    
Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces. 


3    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


4    
I can write sentences but I don't know what they mean , without the power light in a black armor, I'm a dead machine  


5    
I have the base structure of the one reading this ,but without the details 


6    
I only go up and down but I control if something in a room can be found 


7    
I have an upbeat nature but i can't smile , to use me you need an Mp3 file 


8    
You can prove your innocence here with the help of a man clad in black. 


9    
Find the meaning of life. 


10    
I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics.
