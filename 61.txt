I pop like a balloon near fire, stars burn me to produce their godly wildfire/ire .

Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces. 


3    
Crimson red is my body color , transparent in color is what I throw , I can save you or harm you with my force of flow. 


4    
With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me. 


5    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


6    
I am a place where you can find artificially created colors contained in heated glass. 


7    
I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me 


8    
The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white 


9    
My blade is used in medical surgeries, I am created in volcanic forgeries , I can make the sharpest blade that there is, I can found in civil laboratories laboratories. 


10    
I can watch but can't act , people use me to check the matter of facts.
