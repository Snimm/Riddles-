I only go up and down but I control if something in a room can be found

I am a place where you can find artificially created colors contained in heated glass.

I have the base structure of the one reading this ,but without the details

Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces. 


5    
I am a basket that cannot contain anything for I have a hole , when something gets through me ,it's called a goal and that is my only role. 


6    
I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me

I pop like a balloon near fire, stars burn me to produce their godly wildfire/ire .

Find the meaning of life.

I connect two points in space , the reason I'm born is a single case , sometimes I'm made of metal , if gone , consequences can be detrimental

Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode
