1    
I am a screen you cannot touch but only control. 


2    
I am a place where you can find artificially created colors contained in heated glass. 


3    
The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white 


4    
I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics. 


5    
Find the meaning of life. 


6    
I connect two points in space , the reason I'm born is a single case , sometimes I'm made of metal , if gone , consequences can be detrimental 


7    
I can watch but can't act , people use me to check the matter of facts. 


8    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


9    
Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces. 


10    
Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode
