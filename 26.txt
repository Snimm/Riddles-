Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces. 


2    
I am the only book you take a oath to say no lie because if found guilty you will definitely cry. 


3    
I can write sentences but I don't know what they mean , without the power light in a black armor, I'm a dead machine  


4    
I connect two points in space , the reason I'm born is a single case , sometimes I'm made of metal , if gone , consequences can be detrimental 


5    
I am a screen you cannot touch but only control. 


6    
You can prove your innocence here with the help of a man clad in black. 


7    
I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics. 


8    
The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white 


9    
Crimson red is my body color , transparent in color is what I throw , I can save you or harm you with my force of flow. 


10    
With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me.
