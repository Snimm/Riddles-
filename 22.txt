Direction of flow can be deduced so is the end matters status , follow the footsteps to pin fin apparatus

I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics. 


5    
I am a screen you cannot touch but only control.

I can write sentences but I don't know what they mean , without the power light in a black armor, I'm a dead machine

I am a place where you can find artificially created colors contained in heated glass.
