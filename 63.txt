1    
I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics. 


2    
I pop like a balloon near fire, stars burn me to produce their godly wildfire/ire . 


3    
With strength you can't change me, with hand you can't catch me , however something shiny can bend me. 


4    
I only go up and down but I control if something in a room can be found 


5    
I can write sentences but I don't know what they mean , without the power light in a black armor, I'm a dead machine  


6    
I am a screen you cannot touch but only control. 


7    ï»¿I have a part of you but not the rest neither in flesh nor in blood 


8    
You can prove your innocence here with the help of a man clad in black. 


9    
Crimson red is my body color , transparent in color is what I throw , I can save you or harm you with my force of flow. 


10    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer.
