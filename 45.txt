I pop like a balloon near fire, stars burn me to produce their godly wildfire/ire .

Air makes me explode , water makes me explode , the only thing that keeps me safe makes a fire explode 


3    
My blade is used in medical surgeries, I am created in volcanic forgeries , I can make the sharpest blade that there is, I can found in civil laboratories laboratories. 


4    
I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me

You can prove your innocence here with the help of a man clad in black. 


6    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


7    
I am a screen you cannot touch but only control. 


8    
I have an upbeat nature but i can't smile , to use me you need an Mp3 file 


9    
I only go up and down but I control if something in a room can be found 


10    
Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces.
