I connect two points in space , the reason I'm born is a single case , sometimes I'm made of metal , if gone , consequences can be detrimental 


2    
The only war where the battlefield is monotone ,no red in sight, all is in black and white 


3    
I pop like a balloon near fire, stars burn me to produce their godly wildfire/ire . 


4    
I can watch but can't act , people use me to check the matter of facts. 


5    
I am the only thing that does not get dirty when someone walks upon me 


6    
I am a basket that cannot contain anything for I have a hole , when something gets through me ,it's called a goal and that is my only role. 


7    
Walking is a thing of the past . You use me now-a-days, I run on fossilized dinosaur faces. 


8    
I am the only place where you can beat the crap out of something with a hammer. 


9    
I can flow like water but what makes me is rock solid , when I get mixed with water I can ruin your electronics. 


10    
I am the only book you take a oath to say no lie because if found guilty you will definitely cry.
